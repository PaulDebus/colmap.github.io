Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

.. _faq-share-intrinsics:

Share intrinsics
----------------

COLMAP supports shared intrinsics for arbitrary groups of images and camera
models. Images share the same intrinsics, if they refer to the same camera, as
specified by the `camera_id` property in the database. You can add new cameras
and set shared intrinsics in the database management tool. Please, refer to
:ref:`Database Management <database-management>` for more information.


.. _faq-fix-intrinsics:

Fix intrinsics
--------------

By default, COLMAP tries to refine the intrinsic camera parameters (except
principal point) automatically during the reconstruction. Usually, if there are
enough images in the dataset and you share the intrinsics between multiple
images, the estimated intrinsic camera parameters in SfM should be better than
parameters manually obtained with a calibration pattern.

However, sometimes COLMAP's self-calibration routine might converge in
degenerate parameters, especially in case of the more complex camera models with
many distortion parameters. If you know the calibration parameters a priori, you
can fix different parameter groups during the reconstruction. Choose
``Reconstruction > Reconstruction options > Bundle Adj. > refine_*`` and check
which parameter group to refine or to keep constant. Even if you keep the
parameters constant during the reconstruction, you can refine the parameters in
a final global bundle adjustment by setting ``Reconstruction > Bundle adj.
options > refine_*`` and then running ``Reconstruction > Bundle adjustment``.


Principal point refinement
--------------------------

By default, COLMAP keeps the principal point constant during the reconstruction,
as principal point estimation is an ill-posed problem in general. Once all
images are reconstructed, the problem is most often constrained enough that you
can try to refine the principal point in global bundle adjustment, especially
when sharing intrinsic parameters between multiple images. Please, refer to
:ref:`Fix intrinsics <faq-fix-intrinsics>` for more information.


Increase number of 3D points
----------------------------

By default, COLMAP ignores two-view feature tracks in triangulation, resulting
in fewer 3D points than possible. Triangulation of two-view tracks can in rare
cases improve the stability of sparse image collections by providing additional
constraints in bundle adjustment. To also triangulate two-view tracks, unselect
the option ``Reconstruction > Reconstruction options > Triangulation >
ignore_two_view_tracks``.
