Installation
============

You can either download one of the pre-built binaries from
https://demuc.de/colmap/ or build the source code manually.


------------------
Pre-built Binaries
------------------

Windows
-------

For convenience, the pre-built binaries for Windows contain both the graphical
and command-line interface executables. To start the COLMAP GUI, you can simply
run the ``COLMAP.bat`` batch script. The command-line executables are located in
the ``bin`` folder and can be run from the Windows command shell ``cmd.exe``.


Mac
---

The pre-built binaries for Mac only contains the GUI version of COLMAP, since it
is very easy to compile COLMAP yourself. COLMAP is shipped as an unsigned
application, i.e., you have to right-click the application and select *Open*
and then accept to trust the application. In the future, you can then simply
double-click the application to open COLMAP.


-----------------
Build from Source
-----------------

COLMAP builds on all major platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows) with little effort.
First, checkout the latest source code::

    git clone https://github.com/colmap/colmap

The latest stable version lives in the ``master`` branch and the latest
development version lives in the ``dev`` branch. , follow the build
instructions for your platform as detailed below.


Linux

Dependencies from default Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 repositories::

    sudo apt-get install \
        cmake \
        build-essential \
        libboost-all-dev \
        libeigen3-dev \
        libsuitesparse-dev \
        libfreeimage-dev \
        libgoogle-glog-dev \
        libgflags-dev \
        libglew-dev \
        qt5-default

Install `Ceres Solver <http://ceres-solver.org/>`_::

    sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libsuitesparse-dev
    git clone https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver
    cd ceres-solver
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF
    make -j
    sudo make install

Configure and compile COLMAP::

    cd path/to/colmap
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j


Mac
---

*Recommended dependencies:* CUDA.

Dependencies from `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_::

    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install \
        cmake \
        boost \
        eigen \
        freeimage \
        glog \
        gflags \
        suite-sparse \
        ceres-solver \
        qt5 \
        glew

Create the file ``LocalConfig.cmake`` in the COLMAP base directory and then
insert the following lines into it::

    set(Qt5_CMAKE_DIR "/usr/local/opt/qt5/lib/cmake")
    set(Qt5Core_DIR ${Qt5_CMAKE_DIR}/Qt5Core)
    set(Qt5OpenGL_DIR ${Qt5_CMAKE_DIR}/Qt5OpenGL)

Configure and compile COLMAP::

    cd path/to/colmap
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j


Windows
-------

On Windows you have to install the above dependencies manually. To make the
process of configuring CMake less painful, please have a look at
``LocalConfigExample.config``. MSVC12 (Microsoft Visual Studio 2013) and newer
are confirmed to compile COLMAP without any issues.

*Recommended dependencies:* CUDA.

Documentation
-------------

You need Python and Sphinx to build the HTML documentation::

    cd path/to/colmap/doc
    sudo apt-get install python
    pip install sphinx
    make html
    open _build/html/index.html

Alternatively, you can build the documentation as PDF, EPUB, etc.::

    make latexpdf
    open _build/pdf/COLMAP.pdf
